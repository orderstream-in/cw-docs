# Hardware Requirements

## Stable Internet Connection

Every aspect of the system runs online and therefore requires you to be connected to the internet to receive orders. Here are a few recommendations about how to set up your internet:

* Use your own internet connection instead of a shared connection so you have greater control
* Keep a mobile internet connection as a backup in-case there is an interruption with your normal connection. Consider using your phone on hotspot mode for such instances.

IT staff occasionally set up an internet firewall for small business to prevent accessing harmful content. Ensure that orderstream.in is white-listed on your firewall to avoid connection issues to our servers.
{% endhint %}

## Computer or Tablet

To manage your online store and orders, you will need a device that can access the internet. We recommend using a tablet or bigger. Phone access is possible but may be limiting.

## Printer

{% hint style="info" %}
This is optional but very helpful for managing orders
{% endhint %}

You can automatically or manually print new orders using any printer whose drivers are installed on a Android device, Windows or Linux PC. To clarify, this means if you can print from an application like Word or Notepad, then it's compatible with our service. We highly recommend using a thermal receipt printer.

Compatible devices:

* Android 1.5, 1.6, 2, 3, 4
* Windows - 7, 8, 10
* Linux - requires NodeJS
